## OASIS TC Open Repository: openc2-oif-orchestrator

This GitHub public repository [openc2-oif-orchestrator](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-orchestrator) was created at the request of the [OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are separate and distinct from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this TC Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in [Apache License v 2.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/Apache-LICENSE-2.0.txt). That license was selected as the declared [Applicable License](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the TC voted to create this Open Repository.

As documented in [Public Participation Invited](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-orchestrator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited), contributions to this TC Open Repository are invited from all parties, whether affiliated with OASIS or not. Participants must have a GitHub account, but no fees or OASIS membership obligations are required.  Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the open source [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) designated for this particular repository, and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla) that governs intellectual property.

## Statement of Purpose

**OpenC2 Integration Framework (OIF)** is a project to enable
developers to create and test OpenC2 specifications and
implementations without having to recreate an entire OpenC2
ecosystem.  The OIF consists of two major parts:
* The ["OIF Orchestrator" (this repository)](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-orchestrator),
which functions as an OpenC2 producer, and 
* The "[OIF Device](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-oif-device)", which functions as an OpenC2 consumer. 

When used together the OIF Orchestrator and Device implement
both sides of the OpenC2 [Producer / Consumer model](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/v1.0/cs02/oc2ls-v1.0-cs02.html#16-overview). The following diagram
provides a high-level overview of the OIF:

_Motivation_:  The OIF Orchestrator was created with the intent of being an
easy-to-configure OpenC2 producer that can be used in the
creation of reference implementations to control multiple
devices. To that end it allows for the addition of multiple
serializations and message transfer solutions. The intent is
to reduce the time and effort needed to produce an OpenC2
reference implementation. The OpenC2 specification does not
limit the types of data serialization or transport protocols
that can be utilized to deliver the message content. OIF was
built with the capability to easily add serialization and
transport functionality in order to be able to represent a
wide range of use cases. Additionally, OIF allows newcomers
a lower barrier to entry by providing a framework to work
within, allowing a developer to focus their product's
functionality without having to build out the rest of the
supporting architecture.

Short term, OIF is being used to work through
interoperability use cases in order to mature the OpenC2
specification. Long term, OIF plans to help guide the
community towards conformance by providing a validation/test
capability that will determine if the vendor implementation
meets the requirements set forth in OpenC2 specifications.
